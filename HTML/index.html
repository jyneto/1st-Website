    <h1><i>"What are bees?"</i></h1>
  <p>Bees are insects belong to the group of Hymenoptera, just like ants and wasps.
    It´s easy to confuse bees with wasps or certain hoverflies that also have yellow-black coloring.
    All female bees, bumblebees, and wasp in Sweden have a stinger.
  <p>Honeybees and wasp can sting if they find themselves in a difficult situation,
    for example, if they are cornered. </p>
  <p>Bumblebees can also sting, but often they settle for waving a leg to indicare that they want to be left alone.
    Wild solitary bees are very peaceful. They have stinger, but they can´t sting humans with.</p>
  <p>They are also small that the stinger can barely penetrate the skin.
    In Sweden, there are about 270 different species of bees. All except for honeybee, which are wild bees.
    Bumblebees are also considered a type of bee, in Sweden, there are bout 40 species of bumblebees.</p> 
  </p>

  <h1><i>"Why are they important?"</i></h1>
  <p>
    Bees play crucial roll in pollinating, which is necessery for the production of fruits and seeds. 
    This process involves the transfer of pollen within or between flowers. Most flowering plants rely on insects like bees for pollination, 
    though some may use wind or water, and a few can self-pollinate. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Bees visits flowers primaly for food,
    inadvertently aiding in pollination. This mutual exchange benifits both plants and humans, 
    providing us with essential ecosystem services. 
    The diversity of bee species involed in pollination enchances crop yields, 
    resulting in more seeds and better qualtiy fruits in crops like tomatoes, sunflowers, watermelons, coffee, strawberries, apple and cherries. 
    The survival of the bees is threatened by  food scarcity, lack of places to live, toxic pesticides, diseases and Colony Collaps Disorder (CCD).
    These factors necessitate action to ensure bee survival and proctection of the ecosystems and argiculture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h1><i>"No Taco Tuesday?"</i></h1>
    If bees goes extinct, it would be a disaster. We rely on them to help us grow food. 
    We would also have less water because there would be fewer trees to help keep water inte the ground.
    This would lead to food shortage. No taco tuesdays!!
    Our exsistence depends on a healthy planet whith all its creatures. Unless we start to realize this and
    take serious action to save the bees, the future of our planet is in danger.
