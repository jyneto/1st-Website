# 1st-Website
<p>A website about bees that i created during the time i was studying programming. The instruction i got was to use a template and change it to build my own website. It has to have information, a quiz, ui animation and a contact section, that saves the input to my desktop and it should contain a "Please fill in form" animmation and a "Thank you"  animation shows when the contact form is validated and sent. </p>

It is still a work in progress, specially the contact form part. Please go easy on me.

Improve the contact section. I want to save users input i a database and make it look better.
Better responsiveness and
