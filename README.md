# 1st-Website
A website about bees that i created during the time i was studying programming. The intruction i got was to use a template and change it to build my own website. ItÂ´s like simulating real time problems when a developer gets intructed to change somethings i the website. It is still a work in progress, specially the contact form part. Please go easy on me.
